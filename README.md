Custom Asteroids v0.1.0                       {#mainpage}
============

Custom Asteroids is a mod for [Kerbal Space Program](http://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/) that expands the asteroid functionality introduced in version 0.23.5 of the game. It is inspired by the [Custom Biomes](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/66256) mod, particularly the way in which the it can be easily and naturally extended by players.

Custom Asteroids preserves the basic mechanics of Kerbal Space Program, in that asteroids must first be discovered, then tracked to give them a known orbit. However, under Custom Asteroids most asteroids will not be on a flyby course for Kerbin. The released version of this mod instead places asteroids in either a well-defined belt between Duna and Jool, or as a scattered population roaming the inner solar system. Additional populations, such as comets or belts suitable for mods such as Real Solar System, Alternis Kerbol, or PlanetFactory, may be added by third parties.

Players who only wish to use the included asteroid populations need merely install the mod in their `GameData` directory. New asteroids, in both new and old save games, will immediately use the new rules. Asteroids already created, including untracked asteroids, will not be affected. There is no in-game interface; the Custom Asteroids works entirely in the background.

Custom Asteroids is mainly created and maintained by %Starstrider42. Contact him by [private message](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/private.php?do=newpm&u=106949) However, xEvilReeperx was the one who figured out how to manipulate asteroids from within a plugin, making Custom Asteroids possible. In addition, the configuration files for the mod were heavily inspired by Custom Biomes by Trueborn, who deserves all our thanks for filling a gap in the game.
