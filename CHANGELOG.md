============

Custom Biomes conforms to version 2.0.0 of the [Semantic Versioning specification](http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). 
All version numbers are to be interpreted as described therein. Since Custom Biomes does not expose public functions, the [format of asteroid population files](@ref newbelts) will be considered the API for the purpose of versioning.

Version 0.2.0

### Changes 

* Added units to documentation
* Reorganized code to support more general asteroid modifications in future releases.

### New Features 

* Custom Asteroids will now scan the KSP install for asteroid configuration files. This should make it easier to personalize asteroid sets without conflicting with the mod install.
* Custom Asteroids can now control all six orbital elements.
* Orbit size can be set by constraining semimajor axis, periapsis, or apoapsis. Orbit phase can be set by constraining mean anomaly or mean longitude.

### Bug Fixes 

Version 0.1.0
